		<p>From a young age drawing was an outlet for expressing my creativity and imagination. My fascination for drawing allowed me to explore different artists and techniques and I was soon drawn to the more urban letterforms and styles of graffiti. The vibrant colors and unique style of letters created by graffiti artists became a source of inspiration, which evolved into my passion for all things design and typography. I began to examine objects around me and realized that graphic design was everywhere and could be applied to almost everything. Graphic design would become my passion to outlet my creativity.</p>
		
		<p>My graphic work is influenced by typography and illustration. Also, having a background in painting has contributed to my graphic design by use of color application and style. I enjoy graphic design the most when I can add a hand done quality to my work which I feel shows the character of a designer and helps convey the message more personally. Drawing regularly, whether it be doodling during class or working on a two-hour drawing, is important to me as a graphic designer and an artist. Through working hard I aim to build my repertoire of styles and creativity.</p>
